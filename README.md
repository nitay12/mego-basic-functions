# Basic Functions Assignment

Welcome to the Basic Functions Assignment! In this assignment, you will be implementing a set of basic functions in Python and writing test cases to ensure their correctness.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `assignment` directory.
3. Open the `functions.py` file.
4. Implement the following functions:
   - `add(a, b)`: Adds two numbers.
   - `subtract(a, b)`: Subtracts the second number from the first.
   <!-- Add more functions as needed -->
5. Save your changes.

## Testing

We have provided a set of test cases to help you verify the correctness of your implementations. To run the tests, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `tests` directory.
2. Open the `test_functions.py` file.
3. Run the file to execute the test cases.

```bash
python test_functions.py
```
